# .NET API Testing with Playwright

## Introduction
Playwright is a powerful library for browser automation. It also supports API testing, allowing you to test your backend services. This guide will show you how to perform API testing using the Playwright .NET library.

## Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed
- Playwright .NET library installed

## Installation
To install the Playwright .NET library, run the following command:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright
```

## Writing API Tests
Create a new file `ApiTests.cs` and add the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright;

class ApiTests
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        var request = await playwright.APIRequest.NewContextAsync();

        // Example GET request
        var response = await request.GetAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
        Console.WriteLine(await response.TextAsync());

        // Example POST request
        var postResponse = await request.PostAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", new APIRequestContextOptions
        {
            DataObject = new
            {
                title = "foo",
                body = "bar",
                userId = 1
            }
        });
        Console.WriteLine(await postResponse.TextAsync());
    }
}
```

## Running the Tests
To run your tests, use the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```
